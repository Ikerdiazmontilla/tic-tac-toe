Gameboard:
Properties: Board with token positions: 1-9
Functions: clear board, return board

Game: 
Properties:
Functions: playGame, printResult.
Prototype: inherits from board

Player:
Properties: symbol
Function: putToken


Player chooses x or o with a select in a dialog
Player starts with the symbol selected.
When player presses one square, add event listener and the square runs the function put token with its position(id)
Also the textcontent of the target changes through the put token position
And the turn variable changes too along with the textcontent of the turn div
Each turn it prints in the top whose turn it is.
When you press restart it runs the function clear board, which also clears the dom grid.foreach(box => box.textcontent= "")
